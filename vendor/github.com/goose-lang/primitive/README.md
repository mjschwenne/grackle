# Goose primitives

[![CI](https://github.com/goose-lang/primitive/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/goose-lang/primitive/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Primitive functionality provided by
[goose](https://github.com/goose-lang/goose). Everything here is given a
trusted model of its execution.

For common functionality that is verified rather than trusted, use
[goose-lang/std](https://github.com/goose-lang/goose).
