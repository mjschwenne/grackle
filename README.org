#+title: Grackle

Grackle is a project to automate the marshaling and unmarshaling code for [[https://github.com/mit-pdos/grove][grove]].
Effectively, it aims to replace the old marshaling code found [[https://github.com/tchajed/marshal/blob/master/marshal_test.go][here]] by creating a
compiler capable of taking a subset of the [[https://protobuf.dev/][Protobuf]] specification (=.proto= file)
and emitting the Go code which can perform the marshaling and unmarshaling of
the described buffers and a Gallina script which enables reasoning about the
marshaling process.

** Why "Grackle"

A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grackle][grackle]] is a bird capable of mimicking other birds and even human speech if it
wants to, and it's also a bird whose name starts with 'g' to complement [[https://github.com/goose-lang/goose][goose]], a
project which converts a subset of Go to Coq.
